## About Us

Founded in 2020, BirdSO is a Division B and C miniSO Invitational hosted by students from across the country from California and Washington to New Jersey and New York. Our mission is to provide a top-tier competition to those who strive to learn and engage in Science Olympiad.

### The Team
The BirdSO Board consists of both alumni and high school students from across the nation - from Cornell University and UCLA to WW-P High School North and Mission San Jose High School.

#### Eric Ma
My name is Eric Ma, and I am a freshman at UCLA studying...some of the time I guess? I competed in Science Olympiad with Mission San Jose High School for four years in all sorts of events, although my favorites are probably Protein Modeling and Mission Possible. In my free time, you can catch me playing some instrument, taking photos of the sidewalk, and napping to avoid my homework.
