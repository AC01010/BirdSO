<h4>Eric Ma</h4> 
My name is Eric Ma, and I am a freshman at UCLA studying studying electrical engineering. I competed in Science Olympiad with Mission San Jose High School for four years in all sorts of events, although my favorites are probably Protein Modeling and Mission Possible. In my free time, you can catch me playing some instrument, taking photos of the sidewalk, and napping to avoid my homework.

<h4>Vincent Fong</h4>
Hello! My name is Vincent Fong. Iâ€™m currently a freshman at Cornell University, and a graduate from Stuyvesant High School. In my four years of Science Olympiad, I varied between builds and inquiry events; my favorite events were Codebusters and Sounds of Music. In my spare time, you can catch me speedrunning Minecraft and doing quizzes on Sporcle.
