<h4>Roland Hu</h4> 
Hello! I'm Roland and I'm a Palo Alto Scioly alumnus and 1st Yr. studying biochemistry at the University of Washington. Chem lab has been my favorite (and possibly only event) since joining scioly and chemistry itself has been an integral part of my high school years. Whenever i'm not pretending to know chemistry i'm usually playing spikeball or pretending to know python. (:

<h4>Andrew Zhang</h4> 
Hello, my name is Andrew Zhang! I'm a senior (c/o 21) and captain of Syosset High School in New York and have competed since 7th grade. My favorites events are Astronomy, Codebusters, and Fermi Questions but I've also enjoyed participating in Fossils, Material Science, and Invasive Species. In my free time I spend too long playing cryptograms.

<h4>William Lee</h4> 
Hi! I'm William Lee, a captain at Mason. I was introduced to Scioly in my freshman year, and some of my favorite events since then have been Codebusters, Sounds of Music, and Chem Lab. In my spare time, I run, play cryptograms (too much), and play the violin (hah that's a lie).

<h4>Eric Ma</h4> 
My name is Eric Ma, and I am a freshman at UCLA studying studying electrical engineering. I competed in Science Olympiad with Mission San Jose High School for four years in all sorts of events, although my favorites are probably Protein Modeling and Mission Possible. In my free time, you can catch me playing some instrument, taking photos of the sidewalk, and napping to avoid my homework.
